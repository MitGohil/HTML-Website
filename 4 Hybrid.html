                    Variability in Solar and Wind generation has emerged as a concern in large-scale adoption of
                    renewables, especially after it contributes a major share in the energy mix. Hybridisation of wind
                    and solar plant is developing a solution which will reduce this variability due to complementary
                    nature of their generation profile - solar generation is higher during the day, while wind
                    generation can be higher in the night.

                    Hybrid projects would also have much higher capacity utilization, thus removing the intermittency
                    challenge. Such projects also enjoy the additional benefit of a reduction in costs associated with
                    sharing transmission lines. Peak balancing through gas and hydro generation shifting, demand
                    management, smarter grids, electric vehicles as well as storage solutions including battery, pumped
                    hydro and others are expected to further help in smoothing out the variability caused due to the
                    nature of renewable energy supply.
